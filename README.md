### Abstract

Water is a very important and rare natural resource, without which no creature can exist.
Although the earth’s surface is 70% water, less than 3% of this is fresh water, of which 2.2% is contained in glaciers and groundwater. This leaves less than 1% of the earth’s water to meet the needs of humans and species. It has therefore become everyone’s responsibility to try to conserve this very precious resource. Thus, the aim of this study is to numerically localize the advance of the saltwater-freshwater interface, also known as the ”salt wedge” when the medium
is anisotropic. In the first chapter, we will define some basic notions, present some generalities on porous media and recall some interesting results of the saltwater wedge model in the isotropic case. In the second chapter, we will make a numerical study of the salt wedge advance in the anisotropic case
